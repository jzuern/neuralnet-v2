### C++ Neural Network for digit recognizing. Application on the MNIST data set

### VERSION 2: Incorporates more sophisticated programming stuff like parallelization, regularization, ...

## Requirements

- [eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) header files available
- [openMP](http://openmp.org/wp/)

## Build

compile with provided makefile

```
$ make
```

## Usage

Run with
```
$ ./nnet
```



## TODO: Speedup

- use openMP to parallelize learning


## TODO: More sophisticated

- include regularization

- implement read-from-file

- implement convolutionary neural networks
